# This script is a placeholder for future use.
# Currently, ipmonitor handles the flush_pending_changes internally.
# If we need to decouple monitoring from rule application in the future,
# ipmonitor would write pending changes to a file and this script would
# read and apply them.

# For now, this is a no-op as ipmonitor handles flush internally
# Future implementation could read from a pending file and apply rules
